# GIT COMMANDS 

## Initialize a local git and commit
New git.

`$ mkdir MY_PROJECT && cd MY_PROJECT`

`$ git init`


Create a file.

`$ touch README.md`


Add file to index.

`$ git add README.md`


Add all (added/changed) files at ones to index.

`$ git add .`


Commit the added file(s) to the HEAD

`$ git commit -m "README added - first commit"`


## Connect your local git with a server
Connect local repo with server (remote git name must be same as local git name).

`$ git remote add origin <server_address>`


Change remote URL.

`$ git remote set-url origin <server_address>`

*Note: Repository names online and local must be the same*

Show your remote connection.

`$ git remote -v`



Till now, all is proceeded locally.
Loading the files to the server will make them available for others.

`$ git push origin master`


At beginning your work, get a fresh copy first.

`$ git pull`


## Make a branch
Its good practice to have at least this minimal structure: MASTER <---> DEVELOPMENT <---> FEATURE.

  * The master branch should always contain working minor versions
  * The development branch holds the working new features, that are not published or merged into the master branch
  * The feature branch(es) are holding separated features under development


``` shell
$ git branch DEVELOPMENT_BRANCH
$ git branch FEATURE_BRANCH
```


Show all branches.

`$ git branch -a -v`


Then make a branch to work with.

`$ git checkout -b WORKING_COPY`


Double check where you are.

`$ git status`


After your work all is fine and you may wish to merge into your `FEATURE_BRANCH`, first switch into your branch you wish to merge in.

`$ git checkout FEATURE_BRANCH`

Show changes.

`$ git diff FEATURE_BRANCH WORKING_COPY`

Merge WORKING_COPY into FEATURE_BRANCH.

`$ git merge WORKING_COPY`


If you want, you can delete your WORKING_COPY.

`$ git branch -d WORKING_COPY`


Check if there are more branches that are not merged already.

`$ git branch --no-merged`

## Removing  uncommited changes
In the case, you try want to remove all untracked changes in your BRANCH.

`$ git checkout -- *`

Or just the changes in one file.

`$ git checkout -- FILE_NAME`


## Removing  commited changes
First view history and get the hash of your commit(s).

`$ git log`

`$ git log --stat`

or

`$ git log --pretty=oneline`

or

`$ git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"`

or with showing branches and merges in ASCII.

`$ git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" --graph`

`$ git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"  --graph`



### Filter in time
`$ git log --since=1.weeks`

`$ git log --since=2.days`

`$ git log --since=3.hours`

`$ git log --since=40.minutes`

`$ git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"  --graph --since=2.days`


### Show the last commit
`$ git rev-parse --short HEAD` or 

`$ git show -s --format=%h` or

`$ git describe --always` for showing short hash

`$ git rev-parse HEAD` or 

`$ git show -s --format=%H` for full hash


### You can make a own shortcut(s)
`$ git config --global alias.lastcommit "rev-parse HEAD"`

`$ git lastcommit`

### Reset vs. revert
With `reset` all later commit(s) will be gone, you can just go back - history will be changed (use on private branch only).

`$ git reset HASH_OF_AN_EARLIER_COMMIT` 


With `revert` you will make a new commit with the content of the earlier commit, all commits in between stay saved (recommended) - history not changed (good practice on public branch).

`$ git revert HASH_OF_AN_EARLIER_COMMIT` 

You can use relative address with HEAD or a commit hash.

### Now go back to an earlier commit
Choose your commit, copy the hash.

`$ git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"  --graph`


### Just switching without making any changes
`$ git checkout HASH_OF_COMMIT_TO_GO_BACK`


### Reset
`$ git checkout BRANCH`

`$ git reset HEAD~1` resets to the grandparent of the HEAD commit

`$ git reset HASH`   resets to the hash's commit

### Revert
`$ git checkout BRANCH`

`$ git revert HEAD^1` reverts to the parent of the HEAD commit

`$ git revert HASH`   reverts to the hash's commit


### Stash
Situation: The phone rings in the middle of your work and you are told you need to make some corrections in another branch. If you are not ready to commit your current work now, you can stash it.

`$ git stash`

Later, you can return to your work.

`$ git stash pop`


If you don'nt remember, you can list your stashes.

`$ git stash list`


Show diffs of your stashes.

`$ git stash show --patch`

Of course you can make a new branch from stash too.

`$ git stash branch NEW_BRANCH_NAME stash@{1}`

If you want discard a stash you can drop it ...

`$ git stash drop stash@{1}`

... or remove all stashes at ones.

`$ git stash clear`


### Rebase
Situation: While you're working on your feature, the master is updated by someone else.
Now you want to integrate the new master updates into your feature branch.
With `rebase` you can move branches and merge them in one step into a new base to make the history linear again. 

*Note: This will change the history and should only done on your local branch*

`$ git rebase <base>`


If you running in conflicts, use 

`git mergetool` to fix them.
